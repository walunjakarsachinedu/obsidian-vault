### Class
classes are syntactic sugar over prototypical inheritance.   
hoisting possible for classes in javascript meaning create instance before class declaration is not possible.  
  
creating class:
using declaration: `class Student {}``
using expression: `const Student = class{}`
  
define static member: `class Student { static count; }`
