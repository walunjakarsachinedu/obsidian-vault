### Certification
A certification defines what is being reviewed and for which users, who the reviewers will be, what the timeline for the reviews is, and other details.
A certification campaign typically consists of multiple access reviews – for example, a Manager certification can create an individual access review for each department manager, so you have a single certification campaign that consists of a number of access reviews done by different people.

### Access Review
The access review part of a certification is when someone who is an authority of some sort – such as a people manager, reviews the access that other users have, to verify whether or not it is correct and appropriate, and to make any necessary corrections to revoke inappropriate access.

### Types of Certification
- **Targeted** Certification: Most flexible type of certification. It is a process where specific groups of users or access entitlements are selected for review and certification, based on risk or compliance considerations. 
- **Manager** Certification: use by managers to certify their employees ensuring they have right access to do their job. We can configure it to include all or specific managers & also configure which application to certify. 
- **Application Owner** Certification: It is a process where the owners of specific applications within an organization review and approve or revoke the access rights assigned to users for their application.
- **Entitlement Owner** Certification: It is a process where the owners of specific access entitlements review and approve or revoke the access rights assigned to users.
- **Role Composition** Certification: It is a process where the composition of roles within an organization is reviewed and certified by authorized person. The purpose of this process is to ensure that the roles are appropriately defined.
- **Role Membership** Certification: It is a process where the membership of roles within an organization is reviewed and certified by authorized personnel. The purpose of this process is to ensure that the individuals assigned to each role are appropriate.

>**Certification Owner** is person within an organization who is responsible for managing and overseeing the certification process for a particular group of users or entitlements.
